I can help you resolve this issue. Since you've deleted the migrations folder and made model changes, you'll need to reset the migrations and create them again. Here's how to fix it: [1]

First, clear the database migration history through the Django shell: [2]

python manage.py shell

from django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder
MigrationRecorder.Migration.objects.all().delete()

Copy

Insert at cursor
python
For each Django app that had migrations deleted:

Create a new migrations folder

Create an empty __init__.py file inside the migrations folder

your_app/
    └── migrations/
        └── __init__.py

Copy

Insert at cursor
text
Now run makemigrations:

python manage.py makemigrations

Copy

Insert at cursor
python
Finally, apply a fake migration to sync your database schema with the migration history:

python manage.py migrate --fake

Copy

Insert at cursor
python
This process will:

Clear the migration history from your database

Set up fresh migration files based on your current models

Sync the migration state with your existing database schema

Your database content will remain safe during this process. After completing these steps, future model changes should be detected normally when running makemigrations.

If you make additional model changes after this, you can use the regular migration commands as usual:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
